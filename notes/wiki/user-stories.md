# Logout
As a logged-in user, I want to logout via a button on the navigation bar, so that I can hide my account information to the rest of the users on this device.

   ## Questions
 * What page will the user be sent to after being logged out?
   - The user will be redirected to the login page so the next user can seamlessly access their profile.

 * Where will the logout button be located?
   - The logout button will be located in the navbar for ease of access.

 * Will there be a feature that will log an inactive user out of the application?
   - We will not be implementing an auto logout feature for inactive users at this time.


 ## Acceptance Criteria
 * Given that I am a Logged in user when I attempt to log out
 * Then I will be redirected to the log in page as a logged out user
